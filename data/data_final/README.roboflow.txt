10NZD - v1 V1
==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on March 31, 2021 at 2:33 AM GMT

It includes 1470 images.
10NZD are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 15 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -5 and +5 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1 percent of pixels
